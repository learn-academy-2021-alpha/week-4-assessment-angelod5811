1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: An instance variable in Ruby behaves like an object in that it can be inherited by a class.

  Researched answer: What is the difference between class variables and class instance variables? The main difference is the behavior concerning inheritance: class variables are shared between a class and all its subclasses, while class instance variables only belong to one specific class.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: oop and functinal programming are different in the way the hold data

  Researched answer: Both Functional programming and object-oriented programming uses a different method for storing and manipulating the data. In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects and it can only be transformed by creating functions. In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: classes can hold objects. classes are blueprints for creating an instance.

  Researched answer: A class is a blueprint from which you can create the instance, i.e., objects.
